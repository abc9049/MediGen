# MediGen — The Meditation Generator

## Overview
**MediGen** helps people relax, visualize, and reprogram their subconscious mind through personalized guided meditations.  
Each session is generated from user input — simple prompts about their goals, dreams, or desired state — and turns those into a calm, hypnotic voice experience with theta/alpha frequency backgrounds.

## Mission
To merge neuroscience and meditation in a digital experience that helps users explore imagination, healing, and neuroplasticity — all from the browser, instantly, and for free.

## Value
- Encourages relaxation, creativity, and emotional reset.  
- Makes deep visualization accessible without apps or subscriptions.  
- Connects users with personalized content that feels intimate and immersive.  

## MVP Scope
- Web-based only (responsive design).  
- Questionnaire → Script generation → 10-minute voice playback.  
- Free browser Text-to-Speech voice (hypnotic tone).  
- Single looping background audio (432 Hz theta frequency).  

## Vision
A calm digital space where anyone can generate meditations tailored to their inner world — a tool for neuroplasticity, visualization, and daily transformation.
