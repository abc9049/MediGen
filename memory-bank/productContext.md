# Product Context — MediGen

## Why MediGen Exists
Modern meditation apps are too structured. Users crave experiences that feel personal, creative, and emotionally connected — not just guided scripts.  
MediGen fills that gap by generating unique, science-inspired meditations that connect imagination with relaxation.

## Core Philosophy
> “If you can visualize it, you can create it.”  
Inspired by neuroplasticity research, theta frequencies, and teachers like Dr. Joe Dispenza, MediGen focuses on **self-directed healing through imagination**.

## Experience Pillars
- **Calm:** Soothing tone, soft visuals, no clutter.  
- **Personal:** Every meditation is generated from the user’s input.  
- **Free:** 100% accessible, no paywalls or ads.  
- **Science-based:** Uses sound frequencies (4–8 Hz theta, 432 Hz harmonics) for relaxation and focus.

## Tone & Personality
- Voice: Hypnotic, warm, slow-paced.
- Visual: Ethereal, soft glass with breathing motion.
- Message: Encouraging and subconscious-focused.

## Audience
- Creatives, spiritual seekers, people new to meditation.
- Users who want gentle guidance, not spiritual fluff.
- Anyone seeking daily calm moments without downloading an app.

## Future Value
In the long run, MediGen could personalize sessions deeper:
- Track progress (mood history)
- Offer multi-theme soundscapes
- AI voice with more natural tone and emotion
